### Documentation
In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your `lib` directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.

arithmetic.js
arithmetic.add && arithmetic.subtract
- airty - 2 parameters
- expected data is the sum of addition (arithmetic.add) and subtraction (arithmetic.subtract)
- For valid use we expect the sum of numbers via addition or subtraction
- For invalid use (i.e. NaN) entered as arguments, then we expect to see null

greet.js
- airty - 1 parameter
- expected data is a string concatenated with our string argument
- For valid use we expect to see a string output with `hello (string parameter)`
- For invalid use we expect to see null
